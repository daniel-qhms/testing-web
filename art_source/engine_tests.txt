WRITE A STORY, MAKE A GAME

CYOAwesome is a game generator. It's perfect for interactive fiction, visual novels, and gamebooks where you choose your own ending.

You can write a story and it will auto-magically create a multiple-choice adventure game for you. You can optionally sprinkle in a bit of logic inside square brackets to handle keys, stats, quests, sound, and images. You can export to html5, windows, mac, linux, android, and ios.

Learn how by experimenting right now! Just start typing.

There are code examples in the info screen, a bunch of tests, and if you're looking for adventure, proceed to the seaside cliffs!

A BUNCH OF TESTS
The following few paragraphs contain a lot of logic snippets enclosed in square brackets, and will give and take inventory, check conditionals, and provide everything a storyteller needs to handle experience points, locks, keys, memories, feelings, hit points, and puzzles.
- test pickups
- test phrasing
- test inventory
- test hp
- test rpg
